<br/>
**Expected start date**: ASAP

**Job Description**:
TU Delft is seeking two motivated PhD students to work on a project funded by a large industrial partner. The goal of this project is to bring AI and real-time decision making closer to where the data is produced, harnessing the power of locally trained models for privacy-aware sensing at the edge. The project will employ two fully-funded PhDs who will perform research with focus on data management, machine learning, and crowd computing. Successful candidates will develop novel federated (active) systems and for ML at the edge, as well as optimization methods  for ML training and inference on edge devices.

Candidates who are at the end of their Master thesis (scheduled their defense soon) are encouraged to get in contact with us.
