<h5>Meatballs with Red Sauce</h5>

<section markdown="1">


This dish is basically Greek-style meatballs that are submerged in red-sauce and served with rice (that's what my mother does). You first make the meatballs (a.k.a. keftedakia / κεφτεδάκια) and then you mix them in red sauce. 


###### Meatballs:
 - 1kg of minced meat (half-pork-half-beef)
 - 1 not-too-full teaspoon of salt (assuming unsalted minced meat - for instance, since in Belgium it comes salted, do not add more)
 - 1 medium/large onion, dice it finely  - you don’t want to feel the pieces in your bite
 - 2 large eggs (they bind all the ingredients together)
 - Around half a teaspoon of black pepper (coarsely and freshly ground on the spot - not the crappy powder they sell. Lately I use a mortar/pestle to crush it and I think it makes a difference)
 - Two big handfuls of finely chopped parsley - this is possibly the most important ingredient you cannot skip. That’s a lot of parsley but that’s what you need. 
 - Minimum of two tablespoons of wine vinegar
 - Around a tablespoon of dried oregano (or a good handful of fresh thyme, whatever you have)
 - _Optional: a small teaspoon of Cumin (freshly ground/smashed if possible, pre-ground also works) and a handful chopped fresh mint immediately gives this dish a middleastern twist._

Mix them all in a pot and “knead”. Once all the ingredients are well mixed, add panko or breadcrumbs till the “dough” can be formed into meatballs. Lately I prefer panko for some reason. The “dough” should not be too dense: just enough for the meatballs to hold a round shape. Now form the meatballs. Size: something that easily fits in your mouth without having to cut it.

**Frying meatballs** In a pan, add enough olive-oil (see footnote [^1]) to cover at least half the height of the meatballs. They should not be fully submerged in oil (see footnote [^2]). We will not deep-fry those. We’ll greek-fry them. This means that temperature should be low enough for the olive oil to not smoke (should be around 150 degrees, I guess). Fry them on one side, then turn and fry the other side. Dry in kitchen paper once done. Do not overfry them, they will turn out dry. 

[^1]: Olive oil is a first-class ingredient here, just like the meat. We do not use it only as a frying medium. If you use other oils e.g. sunflower or deep fryer oil nonsense, you are losing your time.
[^2]: if you want to use less olive oil, shape the meatballs a bit flatter.

###### The sauce
 - Cover the pan with ca. 5mm of oliveoil stolen from the pan that you fried the meatballs. Very tasty olive oil there. Now, I know that this is a lot of oliveoil. But see [^1] above.
 - One medium onion finely diced (you can skip this one if you don’t want to have onion pieces in your sauce)
 - 4-5 garlic cloves. Yes, it’s a lot. And if you want it even more pungent, use the garlic press instead of chopping them. No mercy.
 - Fry all those in the olive oil till the onions are translucent. I prefer to add the garlic a bit before I add the passata to not fry it too much. That way I smell it even more in the sauce.
 - Then add:
 - 3 cans of passata (maybe 4, I don’t remember - it has to be enough to submerge all the meatballs but not much more). I use 1 with basilicum and two normal ones. Invest in good passata only. Since we discovered Mutti (polpa), we always buy that one. The difference it makes is incredible.
 - Finely chopped fresh thyme (around a couple tablespoons)
 - Finely chopped fresh rosemary (a branch / one tablespoon)
 - Finely chopped parsley (half a tablespoon)
 - Boil till the sauce makes sense (the raw-tomato taste needs to leave, but don’t cook much more)
 - Add salt to taste.
 - Black pepper to taste.
 - Very important: around a teaspoon of sugar and a couple of teaspoons of red wine vinegar. This can make a tomato-based sauce from just OK, to excellent. If too sweet add vinegar, if too acidic, add sugar. You’ll see what makes sense on the spot.

###### Combining
Finally, add the meatballs in the sauce, and boil the whole thing for some minutes. It’s ready.
