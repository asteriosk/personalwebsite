- June 2019:  We are presenting a demo in this year's VLDB on how to execute  stateful functions in the cloud, using streaming dataflows (<a href="/assets/publications/stateful-functions.pdf">pdf</a>), as well as a paper on how to optimize ML pipelines using both linear and relational algebra.
- March 2019:  We received the best paper award from EDBT 2019 for our paper "Efficient Window Aggregation with General Stream Slicing"!
- January 2019:  One full-paper and one vision paper at EDBT 2019.
- December 2018: A poster paper was accepted at ICDE 2019.
- March 2018: I serve as a **local organization chair** of SIGMOD 2019 which will be held in Amsterdam in 2019!
- January 2018: **Two papers** were accepted in next year's **ICDE 2018** in Paris. One on benchmarking stream procesing engines, and one on aggregating out-of-order streams. 
- August 2017: **BlockJoin**, a technique for joining massive datasets producing distributed block-partitioned matrices, will be presented in next year's **VLDB 2018**.
- June 2017: At **SoCC 2017** we are presenting our work on SENSE, a framework for sensor-data gathering.
- August 2016: We will present **Cutty**, a technique for sharing aggregates among user-defined (sliding) window functions in streaming systems, at **CIKM 2016**.
- March 2016: We published a short overview of <a href="http://flink.apache.org">Apache Flink</a> in the **IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin** (<a href="./assets/publications/flink-deb.pdf">pdf</a>).
- February 2016: Our paper on Emma, was accepted for publication at SIGMOD 2015, and will be demonstrated in SIGMOD 2016. Emma received the 2016 <strong>ACM SIGMOD Research Highlights Award</strong>!
